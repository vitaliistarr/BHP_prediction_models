# BHP_prediction_models
Injection data analysis for prediction of Bottom-hole pressure  

The repository contains the code for injection data analysis for Bottom-hole pressure (BHP) prediction.
It includes data preprocessing and analysis, ML models for BHP prediction.


File 'C5_Data_analysis & ML_models.ipynb' is the main file with Injection data preprocessing and 5 ML models built.


File 'Fall_off_analysis.ipynb' contains Pressure Fall off analysis and several prediction models for reservoir mobility evaluation.


File 'Data_generation.ipynb' can be used for Pressure drawdown data generation, including boundary effect on the pressure pattern.
